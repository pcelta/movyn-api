## What Movyn is about

Movyn is a personal project which main goals are:
- To create an API that can provide relevant information about moving to a country.
- To sharpen my coding skills, primarily in PHP, applying good practices, interesting architecture decisions and also good practices in code design. Also, I would like to build up complete functional application which emulates a professional work environment. Therefore, this project will also have CICD, unit tests, local environment with Docker and Docker Compose, and local simplified local commands with Make.

## Road Map

- Define a Entity-Relationship Model
- Consolidate a database with all countries and currencies
- Create a data structure in which countries have features, such as: population, flag, language spoken, open for immigration
- Create the following endpoint: GET /prospects
- - Filters might include: language, population(greater or less than)
